## Permanent spoiler 
Hide all images and videos by displaying a css spoiler. Hover over it to see it.

  position: relative !important;
}

  content: "Hidden";
  display: flex;

  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  background: var(--secondary-background);
  font-size: larger;
  transition: .1s;
}

  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```
